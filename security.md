# Security Considerations

## Address Setup

It is important to ensure that the addresses provided during contract initialization are set correctly and securely. Verify that the addresses for "sablier," "kite," "flx," and "treasury" are accurate and point to the intended contracts or wallets. Any incorrect address could lead to unexpected behavior or potential security vulnerabilities.

## Stream ID Assignment

The "setStreamId" function allows the treasury address to set the stream ID. It is crucial to verify that the stream
ID is set correctly and is not modified afterward. Improper stream ID assignment or unauthorized modifications can result in undesired behavior, potentially compromising the contract's functionality.

## Potential Overflow

The "calculateAuctionedSellAmount" function calculates the auctioned sell amount based on the total balance of the "kite" token held by the contract. The calculated amount is then assigned to a uint96 variable named "auctionedSellAmount." However, if the total balance exceeds the maximum value of uint96 (79,228,162,514), an overflow can occur, leading to unexpected results or vulnerabilities. Ensure that the contract accounts for scenarios where the balance exceeds this limit and handles them appropriately.

# Disclaimer

This security report provides a high-level overview of the contract "Altar" based on the provided source code. It focuses on the identified security considerations but does not guarantee the absence of all possible security issues. It is highly recommended to conduct a thorough review and testing of the contract, addressing the mentioned considerations and other potential vulnerabilities, before deploying it in a production environment. Additionally, ensure that all dependencies and versions used in the contract are up to date and free from known vulnerabilities.
