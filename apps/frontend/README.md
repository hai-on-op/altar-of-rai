# Altar-of-RAI Front-end

This frontend forked from gnosis-auction UX repo. The main modifications happened in the Landing page. I also removed the irrelevant pages, and created a directory for altar specific components.
Some of the pages had bugs and I fixed them. Also there was a couple of features that were not implemented in the auction page that implemented like `settling auction`

## Development

### Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Configure Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change the appropriate variables.

Also change the `ALTAR_NETWORK` to the proper address at `src/utils/index.ts`

### Run

```bash
yarn start
```

To have the frontend default to a different network, make a copy of `.env` named `.env.local`,
change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_ID` to `{yourNetworkId}`, and change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_URL` to e.g.
`https://{yourNetwork}.infura.io/v3/{yourKey}`.
